## Guidance Working Group - Leader: Andrew Hastings Black (Vaisala)
The Guidance Working Group's mission is to provide data-driven recommendations on RSD Standardization and Acceptance.  
 
## Science Working Group - Leader: Alexandra St.Pe (RWE)
- The Science Working Group's mission is to provide data-driven answers to key RSD science questions, it consists of three subgroups 

### Flow Correction Sub-Group - Leader: Scott Wylie (ZX)
- Core mission is to provide data-driven validation of methods used to correct RSD measurements in Complex Flow. 
- Demonstrate typical flow curavature bias based on terrain complexity and roughness, and create a standardized correction methods. 

### Site Suitability Sub-Group - Leader: Alexandra Arnsten (NRG)
- Core mission is to develop tools and standard methodologies for correcting RSD Turbulence Intensity biases when compared to anemometers and RSD's. 

### Power Curves Sub-Group - Leader: Peter Stuart (RES)
- Formerly the Power Curve Working Group
- Core mission is to improve the modelling of turbine performance in real world wind conditions.
